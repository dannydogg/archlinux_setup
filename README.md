# Arch Linux Setup

## Getting started

### Download the image
On a working system, download the latest Arch Linux ISO from www.archlinux.org/download/.

### Set up the bootable USB drive
For an installation on a physical machine, chose a USB flashdrive with at least 4GB storage capacity.

### Set up a virtual machine
For an installation on a virtual machine (VM), prepare the virtualization software. VMs can be set up with different virtualization applications like VirtualBox, VMware, QEMU etc. or on a hypervisor system. System resources on a VM are limited though.
